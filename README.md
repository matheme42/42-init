Introduction subject to System and Network Administration

Slash16 is a network of people who are passionate about system and network administration and/or operations development (DevOps).
Our goal is also to enable a flow of knowledge across our members by setting up
common projects, conferences or via any others type of activity that makes it possible to
share both knowledge and professional experience.
That’s why we decided to treat you with two subjects:
• An initiation subject (This one).
• A complete infrastructure creation subject, roger-skyline-2.
With that, you will have access, on your e-learning platform, to a bunch of videos
that will help you understand the essential notions you’re going to need.

for more information please read the PDF of the subject. I put the subject in subject
